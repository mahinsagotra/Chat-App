### [Live Site](https://quizzical-clarke-09fd02.netlify.app/)

I have created a full Realtime Chat Application. I have used React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.

Setup:
-run `npm i && npm start` for both client and server side to start the development server.
